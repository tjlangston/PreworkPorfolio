    <h3>hello everyone...</h3>
    <p>My name is Tacheyana Langston. I, along with my twin brother, were  born on July 14, 1994 in Queens, New York. 
       I grew up all over NYC, but spent majority of my childhood in The Bronx. In 2008, my mother decided to move 
   to Columbia, South Carolina. After graduating High School in 2012, I decided to join the military. I stayed in the 
military for about 7 years. During my time in the Army, I had two children Nora and Nolyn. After departing from the Army, 
I decided to move to Atlanta, Georgia and I love it here. I obtained my Esthetician certification from Atlanta School of 
Esthetics in 2020.  </p>
