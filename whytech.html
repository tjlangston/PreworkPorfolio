        <h3>Why Tech?</h3>
        <p>
    I've always been secretly into technology, but never fully explored it. Around 2021 Thanksgiving, I was talking
    to my oldest brother, who works in Cybersecurity, about my intrest and he suggested I look into Web Development.
    I went down a rabbit hole on YouTube. And here we are :) Although I have no background or experience, I know that I 
    will do well in the end <strong>beacuse I can do anything I put my mind to!</strong>
